<p>
  Hey, I'm Katherine! I'm an enterprising college student that's seeking to jump into the world of cybersecurity. I've worked an internship managing and repairing systems for multiple different people of multiple different types, and participated in events revolving around system hardening and network security. I consider myself hard-working, perseverant, and a quick learner!

    {<u> Experience </u>}
  </h2>
</div>
<p>
  I've had an internship at a company that involved hands-on repair and management of systems, including BIOS flashes, fresh installs of multiple different operating systems ranging from Windows to Linux distributions, hardware issue detection and reparation, live customer service and assistance, and general maintenance on a multitude of different systems. Additionally, I've also participated within the Cyberpatriot competition, working with a team of peers to analyze systems, detect potential intrusions, and write reports on findings akin to real documentation within the industry.
